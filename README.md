# m text viewer

The `m` program is a simple text mode, text file viewer, developed for my own use, 
so don't expect too much.

The `m` viewer is designated specifically for viewing large text files or input streams, as viewed file is not fully loaded into memory, but are stored in a temporary file instead and read into memory in blocks as needed.


> Note:
The viewer is designated to be used in Unix and/or Mac OS terminals but should also work
in Windows command prompt environment.
